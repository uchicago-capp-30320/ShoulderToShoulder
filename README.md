# Shoulder2Shoulder

A web application to foster community engagement and fight the loneliness pandemic.

## Repository Contents

#### `frontend`
Directory with our web application's frontend development, which is created to display information and interact with users. Our frontend employs Angular.

#### `backend/shoulder` 
Directory with our web application's backend development. Our backend employs Django with an AWS posgress database. The database contains account information, user data, and event data. The backend development team manages the database, the API endpoints, and involves a machine learning component. 

#### `backend/shoulder/ml`
Directory which contains our web application's machine learning development. Machine learning is used by our application to provide users with recommendations for events to attend.

To generate user recommendations, we employ a deep factorization machine (DeepFM). A DeepFM
consists of three main components, as shown in the picture below.

![DeepFM architecture](https://d2l.ai/_images/rec-deepfm.svg)

The embedding layer takes in vectors of user by event information and encodes it into a higher
dimensional space. Each unique feature value is represented by a unique integer which corresponds
to an index into an embedding matrix. For example, if each user by item data point contains
five features and we want to represent features by ten dimensional embeddings, then each of
the five features would have a 1 x 10 embedding vector and the user would have a 5x10 embedding,
which is updated during training. This is equivalent to learning a linear layer but it saves
computation by not having to execute expensive matrix multiplications. The outputs of the
factorizaion machine are raw scores for each user.

The user-event embeddings are then passed into a facorization machine and an MLP. A factorization
machine is like a linear regression that accounts for every second order user-event x user-event
interaction but instead of naively conducting such a regression, the factorization computes
an equivalents but more computationally efficient model.

The user-event embeddings are also passed to an MLP, which utilizes dense layers with relu and
a tunable dropout parameter for regularization. The final output of the MLP are also raw scores
for each user.

Finally, the raw outputs from the factorization machine and the MLP are summed and passed
through a sigmoid function to calculate probabilities of a user attending an event.

Our overall training strategy is to pretrain our DeepFM once we have a sufficient amount of
information and then periodically fine tune it by executing a small number of training epochs
on new data.

## Virtual Environments: Set Up

#### `frontend`

The frontend development uses `npm` as its package manager. To use npm, you first need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). (follow the installation instructions provided on the nodejs website, or run `brew install nodejs` in your terminal). Afterward, to install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

<pre>
```
cd frontend
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```
</pre>

This process only needs to be done once. Once the packages have been installed, `cd frontend` at any time to develop in the frontend. 

#### `backend`

The backend employs a poetry virtual environment with Python 3.12. To create the environment for the first time, follow these steps:
 
<pre>
```
cd backend
poetry env use 3.12
poetry shell
poetry install 

exit //to exit the environment
```
</pre>

You will need to be inside the environment to develop in the backend. If you have already created the poetry environment once before, follow these steps to open the environment: 

<pre>
```
cd backend
poetry env use 3.12
poetry shell

exit //to exit the environment
```
</pre>

## How to use our app

First, make sure you have successfully completed the set up of the virtual environments (see instructions above). 

To open and use the application, you will need to launch both the frontend module and the backend module at the same time in order to get the frontend and backend working in tandem. Follow these steps:

<pre>
```
cd frontend/s2s
ng serve
```
</pre>

Navigate to `localhost:4200/` in your web browser. 

Now, open a new terminal and run:

<pre>
```
cd backend
poetry env use 3.12
poetry shell
python shoulder/manage.py runserver
```
</pre>

Navigate to `localhost:8000/admin` in your web browser and enter the superuser credentials.

To exit the application, run ctrl+C (i.e. ^C) in both terminals to shut down the local hosts.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

#### `backend`: 

<pre>
```
cd backend
pre-commit run --all
```
</pre>

#### `frontend`: 

<pre>
```
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run format
```
</pre>
