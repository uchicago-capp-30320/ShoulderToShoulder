## Meet the Team
- Sarah Walker
    - Sarah is a second year Master's student at the University of Chicago. As a student it can be difficult for her to find time to invest in her social life; she also finds it difficult to meet new people and try new things on such a tight schedule. She is glad to be working on a project aimed at connecting others who may feel lonely or stuck in their daily routines.
