            In 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">acknowledged a profound challenge</a> affecting millions: loneliness and 
            social isolation have reached epidemic levels in America. This 
            growing health concern has profound implications, as loneliness can 
            impact mental and physical health significantly. At Shoulder to Shoulder, 
            we are committed to addressing this silent epidemic through the power 
            of community and connection.

            Our platform is designed not just as a tool, but as a community 
            builder that enables individuals to find and connect with like-minded 
            people in their local area. We believe that meaningful social 
            interactions are a key to improving personal well-being and overall 
            community health. Shoulder to Shoulder offers a dynamic space where

            We facilitate a variety of events and activities, from hiking groups

            it easier than ever for people to engage in shared interests and 
            hobbies, which are crucial for building strong social ties. Whether 
            you're new to the city, seeking to expand your social circle, or 
            simply looking to explore new interests, Shoulder to Shoulder
